# Styles

Main stylesheet imported in entry point should be kept here, as well as any global styles.

Can make another folder for partials, or just add partial files directly.
For example, "_variables.scss" or "_mixins.scss" could be created immediately inside this
"styles" directory, or make a new folder to store any file that constitutes as a partial.
