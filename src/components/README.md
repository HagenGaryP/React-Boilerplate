# Components

Reusable UI components will be kept within this directory.

For example, "Button.tsx", a React Button component that is used throughout the project.
Each component could have its own file for styles, i.e., "Button.module.scss" or "Button.style.scss".

It doesn't matter what you call the scss file, as long as it is specific to the component, relates
to the component it's meant to style, and follows some sort of pattern among other components.
